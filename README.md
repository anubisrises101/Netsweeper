### Welcome to NetSweeper!
This is a new and unique take on a classic game that unless you were growing up during the computer boom of the late 90's you probably have no idea what that even is! So here is a brief description directly taken from the original minesweeper game!

***Minesweeper*** is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden *mines* (depicted as naval mines in the original game) scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. 

The origin of Minesweeper is unclear. According to TechRadar, the first version of the game was 1990's Microsoft Minesweeper. Cited - Wikimedia Foundation. (2024, July 19). Minesweeper (video game). Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game).

So with all that being said, I chose my version of this game based on my wife's ideas! I asked her for ideas for a button to make it different, and her response was a shrimp emoji! She even created the logo you see above. All this lead me down the road of creativity where we are today...

## Information

First off to play the game just click on this [Play Game](https://anubisrises101.github.io/Netsweeper/) link! 

With that out of the way even though the instructions are in the game I will share them with you here. 

    1. The goal of the game is to NOT be caught in a net while navigating the entire board.
    2. You win when all cells of the map are revealed and you have NOT swam into a fish net.
    3. Click on any cell in the map to reveal it. But be careful of fishing nets!
    4. If you happen upon a fishing net congratulations! Your shrimp is now tempura!
    5. As you traverse the map you will notice numbers, they indicate how many nets are adjacent of the cell.
    6. Continue to reveal all the cells by left clicking, and using right click to mark suspected net locations with a buoy!
