# Netsweeper
A unique take on the classic minesweeper game.



// 1) Define the required variables used to track the state of the game. // elaborate on the variables
    // winner, looser, /score/, cellismine, cellisflagged, gameboard, minecount??, /timer/, 

// 2) Store cached element references.





nested for loop to create a grid? 
class of rows, every div is a row 
// 3) initialize the game state and render the board

// 3_set up event listeners for each cell 

// set up click listener to assign flags on a right click/ update the state of the board

//  place mines at random locations on the board 

// 4) upon first click initialize the timer and "net" count

// 5) assign logic for when a cell is clicked it scans the nearby squares, recursive? 

// 6) if no 'nets' in nearby squares initiate a flood 

// 7) if nearby nets assign a number on nearby cells giving a hint to how many are in range

// 8) assign gameover logic for when clicking a net 

// assign game win logic when all nets are flagged

// set up a winner text

// set up button for resetting the game board when clicked

// 1) Define the required variables used to track the state of the game.

// 2) Store cached element references.

// 3) Upon loading, the game state should be initialized, and a function should 
//    be called to render this game state.

// 4) The state of the game should be rendered to the user.

// 5) Handle the game over logic. 

// 6) Handle each instance of a player clicking a button with the use of a 
//    `handleClick()` function.

// 7) Create reset functionality.
